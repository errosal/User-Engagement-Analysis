# User-Engagement-Analysis
User Engagement Analysis helps businesses understand how people interact with their products or services, allowing them to make improvements that make users happier and more likely to stick around. It helps businesses create better UI/UX for their customers and ultimately achieve their goals.

User Engagement Analysis helps various types of businesses, including e-commerce, social media, mobile apps, and online platforms. For example, an e-commerce company can use it to understand how customers navigate their website, what products they like, and how long they stay on each page. It helps the company optimize their website design, personalize product recommendations, and improve marketing strategies to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

For User Engagement Analysis, businesses need data that captures how users interact with their product, service, or platform. It includes information like the number of times users visit a website or app, the actions they take (such as clicks or purchases), how long they stay on a page or within a session, or any feedback they provide. I found an ideal dataset for the task of User Engagement Analysis. You can download the dataset from here.
